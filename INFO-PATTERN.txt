Here is all the pattern I have implemented for my project and where You can find them

1 - Abstract factory pattern
    The whole system of shop and bundle of the project work under this pattern.
    You can find it under the directory "/src/main/java/springproject/project/model/bundle".
    With the actual Abstract being ABundle.java file.

2 - Singleton pattern
    The singleton pattern is used inside jobs run every hour and when creating image or user.
    You can find the Singleton in "/src/main/java/springproject/project/service/Logger.java"
    And used in "/src/main/java/springproject/project/Task/LoggingJob.java"

3 - Iterator pattern
    The iterator pattern is used through all the repository. It helped me when receiving response
    from database query. You can see in "/src/main/java/springproject/project/repository/ImageRepository.java"
    where the list where returned and they are used with the method next(), prev() and {foreach} every where in the code

4 - FieldInjectionPattern
    The field injection is used whenever I used the @Autowired annotation, you can see it clearly in the services and
    controllers directory. I used to inject dependencies between highly correlated classes

5 - Facade Pattern
    The facade pattern is used in the restController under the annotation @TokenConstraint it helped me analyse headers
    request to check if the request was authorized, which make the each controller simpler and easier to use.
    The annotation is defined under "/src/main/java/springproject/project/validator/" directory.

6 - Model View Controller pattern
    The whole project is design under this pattern. I used to organize the whole project. The idea is the view send
    the request to the controller who will call a service which will request the repository then do the way back to
    the view

7 - View helper pattern
    This pattern come with the whole thymeleaf integration, it helped me to insert logic in the view, call method from
    them, throws error for invalid field with custom message. You can see that pattern come to use on every "th:" in
    the views

8 - Repository design pattern
    This pattern helped me to abstract the database and persisting logic from the business logic. It helped to separate
    those 2 logic. You can find all the repository under "/src/main/java/springproject/project/repository/"
